# Doubly linked list in rust

it just does "tying the knot"
explained here: https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/tying-the-knot-haskell/

it ends up being a singleton
that points to it self so you can call tail and
head forever and it just loops around, 
which is kinda neat.

NB: there is an option based branch as well.



My opinion on all this:
__ gosh this was painfull __
